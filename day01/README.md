**Challenge:** #100DaysOfCybersecurity

## 🧩 What I Learned
The **CIA Triad** is the foundation of cybersecurity.  
It stands for **Confidentiality**, **Integrity**, and **Availability**—three principles every security strategy must protect.

| Pillar | Meaning | Real-World Example |
|-------|--------|--------------------|
| **Confidentiality** | Ensuring information is accessible only to authorized users. | Encrypting sensitive emails or using strong passwords. |
| **Integrity** | Keeping data accurate and unaltered unless properly authorized. | Hashing files to detect tampering. |
| **Availability** | Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed. | Redundant servers or DDoS mitigation. |

## 🛠️ Key Takeaways
- Every security control (encryption, backups, access policies) exists to protect at least one part of the CIA Triad.
- Weakness in any pillar can compromise the entire system.
